# 100 Days Of Algorithms
------
## This is my attempt at 100 days of Algorithms.

<b><i>Start Date: March 13th, 2017</b></i>

### Log:
------
<b>Day 0: March 13, 2017</b>

1. [1_simpleSum](https://github.com/wongandydev/100DaysOfAlgorithms/blob/master/Algorithms/1_simpleSum.java): A simple program that takes the sum based on user input, 0 will stop it from adding numbers.

<b>Day 1: March 14, 2017</b>

1. [2_solveMeFirst](https://github.com/wongandydev/100DaysOfAlgorithms/blob/master/Algorithms/2_solveMeFirst.java): A simple program that takes two integers and returns a sum.
2. [3_compareTheTriplets](https://github.com/wongandydev/100DaysOfAlgorithms/blob/master/Algorithms/3_compareTheTriplets.java): Takes six integers from users, compares them in a point system to see who has more points.

<b>Day 2: March 15, 2017</b>

1. [4_aVeryBigSum](https://github.com/wongandydev/100DaysOfAlgorithms/blob/master/Algorithms/4_aVeryBigSum.java): Take Two inputs, first being the array size, second being the values, values should be larger than 10 digits. 
2. [5_diagonalDifference](https://github.com/wongandydev/100DaysOfAlgorithms/blob/master/Algorithms/5_diagonalDifference.java): Given a square matrix of size <i>N</i> calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

<b> Day 3: March 16, 2016 </b>

1. [6_PlusMinus](https://github.com/wongandydev/100DaysOfAlgorithms/blob/master/Algorithms/6_PlusMinus.java): Given an array of integers, calculate which fraction of its elements are positive, negative, and zeroes, respectively. Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new line, only up to six digits after decimal acceptable
2. [7_Staircase](https://github.com/wongandydev/100DaysOfAlgorithms/blob/master/Algorithms/7_Staircase.java): Observe that its base and height are both equal to <i>N</i> and the image is drawn using # symbols and spaces. The last line is not preceded by any spaces.

<b> Day 4: March 17 ,2017</b>

1. [8_MiniMaxSum](https://github.com/wongandydev/100DaysOfAlgorithms/blob/master/Algorithms/8_MiniMaxSum.java): Given five positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers.
