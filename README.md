# 100 Days Of Algorithms


###This is my attempt at 100 days of Algorithms 
Note: While doing this challenge, my goal is to learn another program langauge such as C and write algorithms using that new language instead. My goal is to switch the syntax every 20 - 25 days of algorithms. #challengeWithATwist

1. [12_SherlockAndSquares](https://github.com/wongandydev/100DaysOfAlgorithms/blob/master/Algorithms/12_SherlockAndSquares.java): Given an integer, which is the number of test cases then two integers *A* and *B*, find the number of square roots in the range of *A* and *B*

**Day 9: March 22, 2017**

1. [13_LibraryFine](https://github.com/wongandydev/100DaysOfAlgorithms/blob/master/Algorithms/13_LibraryFine.java): Calculate fine with given conditions:
	1. If the book is returned on or before the expected return date, no fine will be charged
	2. If the book is returned after the expected return day but still within the same calendar month and year as the expected return date 15 x number of days late
	3. If the book is returned after the expected return month but still within the same calendar year as the expected return date, the 500 x number of months later
	4. If the book is returned after the calendar year in which it was expected, there is a fixed fine of 10000 

**Day 10: March 23, 2017**

1. [14_CutTheSticks](https://github.com/wongandydev/100DaysOfAlgorithms/blob/master/Algorithms/14_CutTheSticks.java):

You are given **N** sticks, where the *length* of each stick is a positive integer. A cut operation is performed on the sticks such that all of them are reduced by the length of the smallest stick.


**Day 11: March 24, 2017**

1. [15_GradingChallenge](https://github.com/wongandydev/100DaysOfAlgorithms/blob/master/Algorithms/15_GradingChallenge.java): 

HackerLand University has the following grading policy:

* Every student receives a *grade* in the inclusive range from **0** to **100**
* Any *grade* less than **40** is a failing grade.

Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's *grade* according to these rules:

* If the difference between the *grade* and the next multiple of **5** is less than **3**, round *grade* up to the next multiple of **5**
* If the value of *grade* is less than **38**, no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.

For example, *grade* = **84** will be rounded to 85 but *grade* = 29 will not be rounded because the rounding would result in a number that is less than **40**

Given the initial value of *grade* for each of Sam's  students, write code to automate the rounding process. For each , round it according to the rules above and print the result on a new line.

**Day 12: March 25, 2017**

1. [16_SuperReducedString](https://github.com/wongandydev/100DaysOfAlgorithms/blob/master/Algorithms/16_SuperReducedString.java):

Steve has a string,*s*, consisting of *n* lowercase English alphabetic letters. In one operation, he can delete any *pair* of *adjacent letters* with same value. For example, string `"aabcc"` would become either `"aab"` or `"bcc"` after **1** operation.

Steve wants to reduce *s* as much as possible. To do this, he will repeat the above operation as many times as it can be performed. Help Steve out by finding and printing s's non-reducible form!

**Note:** If the final string is empty, print `Empty String`.
