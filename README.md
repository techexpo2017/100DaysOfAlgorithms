2. [5_diagonalDifference](https://github.com/wongandydev/100DaysOfAlgorithms/blob/master/Algorithms/5_diagonalDifference.java): Given a square matrix of size <i>N</i> calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

<b>Day 3: March 16 ,2017 </b>

1. [6_PlusMinus](https://github.com/wongandydev/100DaysOfAlgorithms/blob/master/Algorithms/6_PlusMinus.java): Given an array of integers, calculate which fraction of its elements are positive, negative, and zeroes, respectively. Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new line, only up to six digits after decimal acceptable
2. [7_Staircase](https://github.com/wongandydev/100DaysOfAlgorithms/blob/master/Algorithms/7_Staircase.java): Observe that its base and height are both equal to <i>N</i> and the image is drawn using # symbols and spaces. The last line is not preceded by any spaces.

<b>Day 4: March 17 ,2017</b>

1. [8_MiniMaxSum](https://github.com/wongandydev/100DaysOfAlgorithms/blob/master/Algorithms/8_MiniMaxSum.java): Given five positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. 

<b>Day 5: March 18, 2017</b>

1. [9_TimeConversion](https://github.com/wongandydev/100DaysOfAlgorithms/blob/master/Algorithms/9_TimeConversion.java): Convert AM/PM time to military time.

<b>Day 6: March 19, 2017</b>

1. [10_ExtraLongFactorials](https://github.com/wongandydev/100DaysOfAlgorithms/blob/master/Algorithms/10_ExtraLongFactorials.java): You are given an integer <i>N</i> Print the factorial of this number.

<b>Day 7: March 20, 2017</b>

1. [11_AppendAndDelete](https://github.com/wongandydev/100DaysOfAlgorithms/blob/master/Algorithms/11_AppendAndDelete.java): Given two strings and <i>K</i> --> Number of Operations. You can do two operations Append or Delete a character. See if you can convert string s to string t with those the given number of operations and using only Append and Delete.

<b>Day 8: March 21, 2017</b>

1. [12_SherlockAndSquares](https://github.com/wongandydev/100DaysOfAlgorithms/blob/master/Algorithms/12_SherlockAndSquares.java): Given an integer, which is the number of test cases then two integers <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> , find the number of square roots in the range of <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>

<b>Day 9: March 22, 2017</b>

1. [13_LibraryFine](https://github.com/wongandydev/100DaysOfAlgorithms/blob/master/Algorithms/13_LibraryFine.java): Calculate fine with given conditions:
	1. If the book is returned on or before the expected return date, no fine will be charged
	2. If the book is returned after the expected return day but still within the same calendar month and year as the expected return date 15 x number of days late
	3. If the book is returned after the expected return month but still within the same calendar year as the expected return date, the 500 x number of months later
	4. If the book is returned after the calendar year in which it was expected, there is a fixed fine of 10000 

**Day 10: March 23, 2017**

1. [14_CutTheSticks](https://github.com/wongandydev/100DaysOfAlgorithms/blob/master/Algorithms/14_CutTheSticks.java):

You are given **N** sticks, where the *length* of each stick is a positive integer. A cut operation is performed on the sticks such that all of them are reduced by the length of the smallest stick.


**Day 11: March 24, 2017**

1. [15_GradingChallenge](https://github.com/wongandydev/100DaysOfAlgorithms/blob/master/Algorithms/15_GradingChallenge.java): 

HackerLand University has the following grading policy:

* Every student receives a *grade* in the inclusive range from **0** to **100**
* Any *grade* less than **40** is a failing grade.

Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's *grade* according to these rules:

* If the difference between the *grade* and the next multiple of **5** is less than **3**, round *grade* up to the next multiple of **5**
* If the value of *grade* is less than **38**, no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.

For example, *grade* = **84** will be rounded to 85 but *grade* = 29 will not be rounded because the rounding would result in a number that is less than **40**

Given the initial value of *grade* for each of Sam's  students, write code to automate the rounding process. For each , round it according to the rules above and print the result on a new line.

**Day 12: March 25, 2017**

1. [16_SuperReducedString](https://github.com/wongandydev/100DaysOfAlgorithms/blob/master/Algorithms/16_SuperReducedString.java):

Steve has a string,*s*, consisting of *n* lowercase English alphabetic letters. In one operation, he can delete any *pair* of *adjacent letters* with same value. For example, string `"aabcc"` would become either `"aab"` or `"bcc"` after **1** operation.

Steve wants to reduce *s* as much as possible. To do this, he will repeat the above operation as many times as it can be performed. Help Steve out by finding and printing s's non-reducible form!

**Note:** If the final string is empty, print `Empty String`.
